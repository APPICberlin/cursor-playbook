# Hotfix Procedure — Urgent Fixes

1. **Definition**
   - A **hotfix** is a critical change required to restore production or staging functionality, fix a major security vulnerability, or resolve a blocking bug.
   - Hotfixes bypass normal sprint cycles but still follow QA and documentation requirements.

2. **Trigger & Approval**
   - Triggered by detection of a critical incident.
   - Requires PM or designated release owner approval before starting.

3. **Branching**
   - Branch from the relevant release tag or `main` if no tag exists.
   - Name: `hotfix/<ticket-id>-<short-description>`.

4. **Implementation**
   - Limit scope strictly to the urgent issue.
   - Avoid unrelated changes or refactors.
   - Maintain SCOUT coding standards.

5. **QA Loop**
   - Write or update relevant tests for the fix.
   - Perform manual testing on affected flows.
   - Ensure CI passes before deployment.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy directly to production after validation and approval.
   - Tag as `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-hotfix`.

7. **Post-Hotfix**
   - Document the issue, resolution, and lessons learned in `/docs/LEARNING_LOG.md`.
   - Merge hotfix branch back into `main` and other active branches to avoid regression.
