# Integration Guidelines

1. **Evaluation**
   - Review vendor documentation and licensing before integration.
   - Assess reliability, SLAs, and security implications.

2. **Implementation**
   - Use a dedicated integration layer/module.
   - Keep third-party code isolated from core business logic.

3. **Security**
   - Authenticate securely (OAuth2, API keys from vaults).
   - Validate and sanitize all incoming data.

4. **Resilience**
   - Implement retries with exponential backoff.
   - Handle and log all API errors gracefully.

5. **Monitoring**
   - Track API usage and error rates.
   - Set alerts for performance degradation or quota limits.

6. **Documentation**
   - Maintain integration docs in `/docs/integrations`.
