# Performance Standards — Required Practices

1. **Code Efficiency**
   - Avoid unnecessary computations in hot paths.
   - Prefer O(1) or O(log n) algorithms for frequent operations.
   - Minimize synchronous blocking in async flows.

2. **Database Performance**
   - Use indexes for frequently queried fields.
   - Avoid N+1 query patterns.
   - Batch operations when possible.

3. **Caching**
   - Use in-memory caches for repeated expensive computations.
   - Invalidate caches correctly to avoid stale data issues.
   - Apply appropriate TTLs for cache entries.

4. **API & Network**
   - Minimize payload sizes (use compression, remove unused fields).
   - Use pagination for large data sets.
   - Optimize query parameters and endpoints to reduce latency.

5. **Testing Performance**
   - Include performance-sensitive scenarios in test suites.
   - Establish and monitor baseline metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage).
   - Fail builds if performance regressions exceed agreed thresholds.

6. **Scalability**
   - Design systems to handle at least 2x expected peak load.
   - Use horizontal scaling where applicable.
   - Keep critical paths stateless unless unavoidable.

7. **Monitoring**
   - Track performance metrics via APM tools or logs.
   - Alert on degradation beyond SLA targets.
   - Regularly review logs for anomalies.

8. **Review & Optimization**
   - Profile code before optimization; avoid premature optimization.
   - Document any trade-offs made for performance reasons.
   - Revisit performance assumptions quarterly.
