# Environment & Configuration Standards

1. **Separation of Environments**
   - Maintain strict isolation between dev, staging, and production.
   - No direct DB or service connections between environments.

2. **Configuration Management**
   - All environment variables in `.env` or equivalent, never hard-coded.
   - Provide `.env.example` with required keys and safe defaults.

3. **Secrets**
   - Store all secrets in secure vaults (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
   - Rotate credentials according to security policy.
   - Never commit secrets to version control.

4. **Access**
   - Grant least privilege required for each environment.
   - Require approval for production environment changes.

5. **Auditing**
   - Log all configuration changes in `docs/CONFIG_CHANGE_LOG.md`.
