# Deployment & Release – Standards

1. **Pre-Deployment Checks**
   - All tickets in the release must meet Definition of Done (DoD).
   - CI pipeline: all checks (lint, tests, build) must pass.
   - No unresolved critical bugs or regressions.

2. **Approval**
   - Production deployments require explicit approval from PM or designated release owner.
   - Staging deployments can be initiated by any contributor with write access.

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Use approved deployment pipeline; no manual production deploys unless approved.
   - Tag release in version control: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

4. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Verify main application flows in target environment.
   - Run smoke tests and critical path checks.
   - Document deployment outcome in `/docs/DEPLOY_LOG.md`.

5. **Rollback Plan**
   - Maintain rollback instructions for the current release.
   - Ensure prior stable version is available for immediate restore.
