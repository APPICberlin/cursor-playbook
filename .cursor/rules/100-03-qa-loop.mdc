# QA Loop – Mandatory Steps for Every Change

1. **Pre-Implementation**
   - Read relevant docs in `/docs` and the current task description in `TODO.md`.
   - Clarify unclear requirements before coding.

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow SCOUT coding standards and naming conventions.
   - Keep code modular, reusable, and well-commented.

3. **Self-Review**
   - Compare changes against acceptance criteria.
   - Check for security issues, performance impact, and potential regressions.

4. **Testing**
   - Write or update unit/integration tests.
   - Run full test suite locally and ensure all pass.
   - Perform manual testing on all affected flows.

5. **Documentation**
   - Update `/docs` and `CHANGELOG.md` if relevant.
   - Log important decisions in `/docs/decisions.md`.

6. **Handoff**
   - Summarize changes, tests performed, and any known limitations.
   - Only then request merge/release.
