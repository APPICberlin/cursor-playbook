# 000-01 — Global Principles

## 1) Purpose & Precedence
- This rule defines non-negotiable, project-wide principles.
- **Precedence:** If any other rule conflicts, **this rule wins**.
- **Scope:** Applies to humans and Cursor Agents (Ask/Agent/Background).

## 2) Read-Before-Work (Docs-First)
Before editing code, the assignee must read and, if missing, create/update:
- `docs/README.md` (run/build/test)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (modules, boundaries, data flow)
- `docs/UI_GUIDELINES.md` (tokens, components, patterns)
- Relevant ADRs under `docs/DECISIONS/`
- The ticket’s Acceptance Criteria (DoR/DoD)

If required docs are missing, **write them first** (stub allowed), then proceed.

## 3) Planning & Tickets
- Work only from a ticket with a clear **Problem**, **Scope**, and **Acceptance Criteria**.
- Keep diffs **minimal** and scoped to the ticket.
- Branch naming: `feat/<id>-<slug>` or `fix/<id>-<slug>`. Conventional Commits. Squash on merge.

## 4) Working Mode & Safety
- Start in **Ask** mode to confirm scope; switch to **Agent** only after a short plan is produced.
- **Checkpointing:** After each major edit, run lint/tests; summarize progress in the PR.
- **Failure guard:** After **2 failed attempts** (tests/CI), **stop**, open PR with findings, and request review.
- Do not churn unrelated files. No speculative refactors w
